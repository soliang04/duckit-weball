Hi Everyone! 

This is our LAHacks 2023 submission created by Anish Goel, Jonathan Vu, Christina Pham, and Sophia Liang.

We introduce to you a revolutionary web-based platform that uses cutting-edge speech recognition technology to automatically transcribe audio files into detailed notes. 

With our platform, you can easily upload any audio file format, such as mp3, and watch as our AI-powered speech recognition engine transcribes every word into clear and accurate text. Our platform is perfect for anyone who wants to improve their learning or productivity, by converting audio files into more efficient notes. It's especially useful for students who need to review lectures, professionals who attend meetings and conferences, and anyone who wants to improve their note-taking skills. Our interactive speech-to-analysis website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to everyone, whether you're a tech-savvy individual or not.
